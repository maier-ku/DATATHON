# DATATHON

Bristol Data Science Society Datathon- Sponsored by London Victoria Insurance Company.

In this competition, you will build the best predictive model based on historical insurance data. 
For the Datathon, you can use the programming language and data analysis libraries of your choice.

The test dataset (without labels), which is called "bdss_datathon_test_nolabel.csv" - it is in the same folder as the training dataset, which you can find here: 
https://bit.ly/datathon-files

You should predict the variable "Insurance_Purchased" based on the features in the test datset and submit your predictions with the file "<team_name>.csv". So, if your name is "Data Warriors", your submission file should be called "Data-Warriors.csv".

Also, some clarification about the data:

All Zip-Code level variables (e.g., religion, income) use the same scale/mapping as the variable "Roman Catholic" (where you have a mapping from number to a % of Zip Code population range); all contribution variables use the same scale/mapping.
